# Food Rating Application ("Picture this")

This one is a Food Rating App I created whilst studying Mobile Development.

In this application the user can rate 4 types of food and by clicking on the images they can
fill in information about them (like cuisine, name, date the picture was taken ect.)

Relevant information:

* The information inserted by the user is preserved even when switching activities
* The application uses parcelised objects to transfer information between activities.
* There is a basic level of input validation.

Here are some photos:
