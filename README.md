# Android-Mobile-Development
A repository containing applications that I created in Android Studio whilst studying Mobile Development.

The number of application I've developed are 3 and those are:

* [Food rating app](https://github.com/PaulLafaz/Android-Mobile-Development/tree/main/Food%20Rating%20App)
* [Town info app](https://github.com/PaulLafaz/Android-Mobile-Development/tree/main/Town%20Info%20List%20App)
* [I am sick app](https://github.com/PaulLafaz/Android-Mobile-Development/tree/main/I%20am%20sick%20App)

Feel free and take a closer look!
