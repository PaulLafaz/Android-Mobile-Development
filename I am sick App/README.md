# I am Sick Application

Here is my very first application I developed during my time studying Computer Science.

This app's functionality is very simple:

It features 3 buttons each with unique functions:
 * _1st button decreases the counter by 1_ 
 * _2nd button increases the counter by 2_
 * _3rd one plays a sneezing sound_
 * _The colour of the counter changes depending on its number._

Another notewortyhy function of the app is that is saves its state so that when the app is minimized or its activity is paused. 

The app also contains a locale file that makes it available in Greek and a layout file that is displayed 
when the user rotates their phone. 
 
This is what the application looks like:

 _Main Screen - Englisht Version:_ | _Main Screen - Greek Version:_
-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------

This is also what the app looks like in a horizontal layout:

Feel free to take a closer look at the code!
