# Town Info Application ("My Town")

Here is a Town Info List app I've developed during my time studying Computer Science.

The purpose of this app is to: 
* Read inforamtion about towns and cities around australia stored in a text file 
and display them to the user in a scrollable list
* Display extra infromramtion using a toast when the user taps on a city in the list



### Here are some images of what the applications looks like:
